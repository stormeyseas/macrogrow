\arguments{
\item{U0}{incoming incident water velocity (m/s)}

\item{macro_state}{vector of named numbers. Must include:
\itemize{
\item \code{biomass}, macroalgae wet weight (g)
\item \code{hm}, algae height (m)
}}

\item{site_params}{vector of named numbers. Must include:
\itemize{
\item \code{hz}, total water depth (m)
\item \code{hc}, vertical water column occupied by the canopy (m)
\item \code{d_top}, depth of the top of the canopy beneath the water surface (m)
}}

\item{spec_params}{vector of named numbers. Must include:
\itemize{
\item \code{SA_WW}, conversion of wet weight to surface area
}}

\item{constants}{vector of named numbers defining extra constants for the attenuation submodel. Must include all constants, which have the following default values:
