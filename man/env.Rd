\title{Example environmental time series data}
\format{
A data frame with 365 rows and 8 columns:
\describe{
\item{t}{Time step (day of year)}
\item{temperature}{Water temperature (°C)}
\item{light}{Surface light availability (μmol photons m-2 s-1)}
\item{kW}{Light attenuation coefficient in water (m-1)}
\item{velocity}{Mean water velocity (m s-1)}
\item{salinity}{Salinity (g L-1)}
\item{nitrate}{Nitrate concentration (mg m-3)}
\item{ammonium}{Ammonium concentration (mg m-3)}
}

\description{
A data frame containing synthetic environmental data over a full year (365 days) with seasonal patterns and random variation. This dataset demonstrates the expected format for environmental forcing data used in the macroalgae growth model.
}
\details{
The environmental data includes:
\itemize{
\item Seasonal temperature variation (15°C ± 3.5°C with random noise)
\item Light availability with seasonal patterns
\item Seasonal variation in light attenuation coefficient
\item Seasonal variation in water velocity
\item Salinity variation around 35 g/L
\item Nitrogen concentrations (nitrate and ammonium) with seasonal patterns
}

All variables include random variation to simulate natural environmental conditions.
